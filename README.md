### Join our Discord server

We've set up a Discord server for adhoc communication. You can join it [here](https://discord.gg/ASDSFjGAAW).

## Governance

Since WeAreMahsaAmini is an open-source project we are going to govern it as a team.

1. Ideas are being introduced by the community
2. The idea will be picked up by a project lead
3. A new repository will be created and the project lead will become the owner of the repo
4. The project lead is responsible for creating the contribution guidelines for the project
5. If the lead of a project steps down or the project becomes stale, another project lead can claim the project

We are going to discuss as a community what are the minimum requirements for becoming a project lead.
